//! Distributed checkpoint save/load coordination.
//!
//! In DDP training, all workers hold identical weights (C-DDP-001).
//! Only rank 0 writes the checkpoint to avoid concurrent file writes.
//! A barrier ensures all workers sync weights to CPU before rank 0 saves.
//!
//! # Protocol
//!
//! 1. Coordinator broadcasts "save" command (heartbeat with special timestamp)
//! 2. All workers call `sync_weights_to_cpu()` on their CUDA trainers
//! 3. All workers send a "ready" acknowledgement
//! 4. Rank 0 writes checkpoint (model.safetensors + config.json)
//! 5. Rank 0 broadcasts "save complete"
//! 6. All workers resume training
